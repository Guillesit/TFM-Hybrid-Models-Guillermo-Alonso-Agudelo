Everything can be found on the Releases downloadable or in the master branch.  
This is a list of the contents inside each model's folder: 

  -A series of folders numbered which contain the results of each realization of the simulation.  
  -The code used for the simulation including:  
    +Main.cpp The code executed to obtain the results where the main loop is hosted  
    +Header.h Header code containing the references to all functions  
    +FKSolver.cpp Contains the functions necesary to solve the deterministic PDE  
    +Gillespie.cpp Only in the codes with stochastic part to take care of it 
    +Read.cpp Functions to read and write the information from/to txt files 
    +Utilities.cpp Rest of the functions necessary for the program
  
  -A set of videos and all frames of the simulation with different parameters.  
  -Other codes and information for testing, with the parameters used for the videos.

Outside the folders there is also the .sh code to execute all models and the results.ipynb code to see the results of all models.
There are also videos of all models for a simulation with all sharing the same parameters.
